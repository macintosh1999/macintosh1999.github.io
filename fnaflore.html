    there was an engineer named William Afton who loved making robots and he decided to start a restaurant that had animatronics with his
good ol buddy Henry Emily. together they created Fredbear's Family Diner staring Fredbear the yellow bear and Springbonnie the yellow bunny.
they were good until a day in 1983 when his son Michael and his friends put his youngest son which the name of is debatable but
most argue its Evan but anyway they trap Evan in Fredbear's mouth as a "prank". Fredbear then proceeds to clamp down on Evan's head, killing him.
after that Fredbear's Family Diner closed for good and William and Henry were left with a tragedy and a lost son.
there were also 3 employees that got springlocked but its not important.

after 1983 William and Henry created another restaurant called Freddy Fazbear's Pizzea featuring Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie, Chica and Foxy who
William hated so much he shoved him in the corner of the restaurant. it was all good
UNTIl one day William had too many flintstone gummies and went batshit crazy. he saw Charlie, Henry's daughter near a window at Freddy's and 
decided to kill her. he did so and it felt good for him so he decided to kill more kids.
he lead 5 kids into the safe room at Freddy's dressed up in a Springbonnie costume telling them that their dog died and
they will find a new one in the safe room.
after he trapped all 5 kids he absolutely murdered em, stuffing all the bodies in the springlock suits in there.
he trapped one in an old Fredbear suit, which he didn't know was "posessed" by Evan's soul after he got killed by it. 

still after the murder the restaurant was not shut down. but shortly after William was fired from his own company and Henry became the new
owner of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. after a while the restaurant gets shut down because of health code violations and William decided to start his
own company, Afton Robotics.after William found out that a substance called "Remnant" is responsible for the animatronics moving on their own,
but most importantly being able to give souls "immortality", he would make a new location 
called Circus Baby's Entertainment and Rentals, to collect more of it and study it.

William designed a few animatronics designed to murder children and collect their remnant. one of them being Circus Baby, who
would then murder William's daughter, Elizabeth after she got too close to Circus Baby.

after the loss of Elizabeth, William closed CBEaR for good, blaming it on gas leaks.
